A modern design and UI for the WooCommerce admin. Manage, search, and navigate orders faster. Make the WordPress admin dashboard ecommerce-focused.

== Description ==

Dashify brings a modern design and UI to the WooCommerce admin. Manage, search, and navigate orders faster.

Just activate Dashify, and you’re all set! Your existing WordPress admin turns into a beautiful, ecommerce-focused admin panel. No configuration necessary.

### Features

Dashify doesn’t just give a fresh look to the WooCommerce admin—it also adds new functionality, marked with a star ⭐ below!

#### WooCommerce-focused admin menu

- Clear separation of WooCommerce from other WordPress menu items.
- “Orders” and other WooCommerce submenu items are moved to the main admin menu, making them easier to find.
- The navigation gets a modern style inspired by other popular apps (Shopify, Notion, Stripe).
- Compatible with Admin Menu Editor.
- If a plugin adds a menu item, you’ll find it in Dashify’s navigation too.
- Doesn’t suit your store? You can turn it off without affecting the rest of Dashify.

#### ⭐ Order trend graphs

- See trends with a graph of total, refunded, and completed orders above the order list.
- For WooCommerce Subscriptions, see subscription revenue, the number of new subscriptions, and the number of cancelled subscriptions.
- Choose between Today, Last 24 hours, 7 and 30 day time periods.

#### Order list

- Order status filters are big and easy to click.
- Bulk actions appear only when at least one item is selected, and they are sticky as you scroll the order list.
- The search bar and filters are grouped together, only visible when in use, and can be opened with the “F” keyboard shortcut.
- Filters can be cleared all at once, or one at a time.
- Table is fully responsive to screen size and works well on mobile devices.

#### Order view/edit

- Switching from Shopify to WooCommerce? Manage orders in a **Shopify-like UI**.
- ⭐ **Next and previous order buttons** with keyboard shortcuts.
- ⭐ **Jump to orders of the same status.** Based on the order status selected in the order list, after clicking into an order, the next and previous buttons will go to the next or previous order of the same status.
- ⭐ Date and time formatted according to region.
- ⭐ Back button to get back to the order list.
- Order number, status, and date are moved to the top for visibility.
- Action and update buttons are grouped together at the top.
- Order notes become a Timeline.
- Timeline text box automatically expands as you type more.

### Dashify Pro

[Dashify Pro](https://getdashify.com/#pro) brings even more improvements to the WooCommerce admin.

- **Get the Dashify theme on more WooCommerce pages.** With Dashify Pro, the **product list** and **WooCommerce settings** are also styled. More pages coming soon! [Check out the roadmap for details](https://getdashify.com/roadmap/).
- ⭐ **Find orders quickly with global search.** Dashify Pro adds a “Search orders” button to the WordPress admin toolbar, allowing you to find an order by ID, customer name, email, phone, or product SKU within an order. This AJAX search is faster because it doesn’t require a full page reload, unlike the standard WooCommerce order search. It also shows recent orders so you can jump to those quickly.
- ⭐ **Hide specific custom fields in orders and subscriptions.** You can mark custom fields as hidden, and then they won’t show in any order or subscription edit view.
- ⭐ **Sort order line items by SKU.** When packing orders with many items, this helps you find items faster if they’re also sorted by SKU in your warehouse or fulfillment center.
- ⭐ **Sort order line items by product menu order.** The items in a customer’s order can be sorted the same as they appear in the admin product list “Sorting” view and on the Shop page.

### Compatibility

Dashify should work with most plugins for the WooCommerce admin.

Here are the plugins we’ve extensively tested and designed Dashify to be compatible with:

- WooCommerce Subscriptions
- Admin Menu Editor — Janis Elsts
- PDF Invoices & Packing Slips for WooCommerce — WP Overnight
- WooCommerce PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes and Shipping Labels — WebToffee
- Payment Plugins for Stripe WooCommerce — Payment Plugins
- RD Order Modifier for WooCommerce — Robot Dwarf
- Order Tags — 99w
- PW WooCommerce Gift Cards — Pimwick, LLC
- Smash Balloon Social Photo Feed — Smash Balloon
- FiboSearch — FiboSearch Team
- Ultimate Dashboard — David Vongries

If you find a plugin that’s not compatible, leave a message in the [WordPress.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/dashify/) or contact us through the [Dashify Help Desk](https://forms.gle/pRezSbdUcZmvZdX27), and we'll gladly add compatibility for it.

You can turn Dashify on and off quickly through the WordPress screen options in case you have occasional plugins or workflows not currently supported by Dashify.

### Troubleshooting

- If the order edit layout doesn’t look right, whether Dashify is on or off, turning it on/off again through the screen options will reset the layout.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I give feedback, report a bug, or request a feature? =

Yes! Tell us what you would like to see in the [WordPress.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/dashify/) or through the [Dashify Help Desk](https://forms.gle/pRezSbdUcZmvZdX27). We read and appreciate all feedback.

= What data does this plugin collect? Is it safe? =

Dashify doesn’t collect any data, not even analytics. It only restyles and adds features to your WooCommerce admin.

= Will this slow down my admin? =

Dashify requires some new code to run, but the impact on load time should be minimal. We monitor this carefully. If you feel Dashify slows down your admin considerably, reach out to us!

= Is Dashify compatible with my plugins? =

Dashify is designed to work with most admin plugins, and we have an official [compatibility list on our website](https://getdashify.com/compatibility/). If you find something that doesn’t work, reach out to us and we’ll get it fixed.

== Screenshots ==

1. Dashify removes the clutter from the order list, gives it a modern style, and adds order trend graphs. Dashify also replaces the standard WordPress admin navigation with an ecommerce-focused one that makes all the WooCommerce menu items easily visible.
2. In the order view, Dashify adds pagination buttons (with keyboard shortcuts) to go to the next or previous order, as well as a button to go back to the order list. It gives the page a new style and moves important information and actions to the top.
3. The order notes become a timeline.
4. After filtering by order status and clicking into an order, you can use the previous and next buttons to jump to orders of the same status.
5. Without Dashify, the order list search and filters are spread out among other elements above the list, making it confusing. With Dashify, they’re grouped together behind a single button that reveals them when you want to find orders.
6. The order list is fully usable on mobiles devices. You can scroll left and right to view more columns.
7. Dashify Pro: Search for and view recent orders from anywhere in the WordPress admin.
8. Dashify Pro: Hide custom fields that you don’t need to see across all orders.
9. Dashify Pro: WooCommerce settings with the Dashify theme.
10. Dashify Pro: The product list with the Dashify theme.

### 1.2.0 (2024-03-27)

#### New features
- **Paginate to the next order of the same status!** If an order status is selected in the order list and you click into an order, the order status filter is taken into account when using the next and previous order buttons. It will jump to the next or previous order of the same order status, allowing you to, for example, handle "Payment pending" orders one at a time. You can clear this filter at any time from the order view.

#### Improvements
- The order date and time is entirely localized, including aspects like whether it should show AM/PM or use a 24-hour clock.

- A few JavaScript errors about null elements.

### 1.1.3 (2024-03-15)

- Order pagination will end at the newest/oldest order instead of paginating to the same one when on the newest/oldest order.
- Analytics range selection is saved.

### 1.1.2 (2024-03-06)

#### Bug fixes
- If any JS error happened, the page would be blank. Now, it will render the page even if errors are encountered along the way.
